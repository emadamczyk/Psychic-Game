# Psychic-Game

I am completing this activity and hope to also successfully complete the hangman game.

I used an array of the alphabet to validate guesses as letters. A guess does not count against a player if they player does not guess a letter. For non-letter guesses, an alert pops up to let the player know to choose only letters for this game.

When the player guesses the correct letter, an alert notifies the player that they won and what the winning letter guess was. Play resumes. If a player does not guess the correct letter with 10 chances, an alert notifies the user of what the correct letter is and that they did not guess it. If the player accumulates 7 losses,an alert notifies the player that this game may not be the right one for them. If the player wins 3 rounds before losing 7 rounds, the player gets a congratulatory message for being a true psychic.
